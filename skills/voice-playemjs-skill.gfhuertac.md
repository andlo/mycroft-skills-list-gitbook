### _voice-playemjs-skill.gfhuertac_  
## Description:  
There are some music providers that require a ui to work, making them hard to control from audio-only controllers such as mycroft, unless you connect to a third party proxy. this skill tries to solve this.

in order to do that, we leverage playemjs, a js player for online sources such as youtube, vimeo, deezer, and using a headless browser (firefox) and xvfb (if available), we launch an instance of the player and are able to control it using voice commands.

this is a proof of concept and we hope that it can help others to achieve similar stuff.
