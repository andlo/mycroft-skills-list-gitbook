### _PFE1718-automation-handler.PFE1718_  
## Description:  
The automation-handler skill is part of the habits automation system that aims to detect the user habits when using Mycroft, and to offer automation of these identified habits. You can find a detailed definition of a habit on the project page.
This skill allows you to automate some of the habits that Mycroft has detected and it handles their automation. When you first reproduce a detected habit, Mycroft will ask you if this habit should be automatized.
The habit detection is done by two other complementary skills
1. The skill-listener, that logs the user activity. It is also  responsible for launching the 2 other skills when needed.
2. The habit-miner, that extracts the habits of the user from the logs.
