story timeThis skill tells story that changes what happens next each time

Start a story by saying "Mycroft, tell me a story."
It will then start the story and randomly choose each chapter for the reader.

To get this done we need
- A sound effect for the page flip
- Randomly pick between two chapter options- Speak the result.
