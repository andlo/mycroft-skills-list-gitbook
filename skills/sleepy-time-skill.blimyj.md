## Description:  
When activated it will play a local audio file to help you sleep.
Automatically pauses when Mycroft is listening or speaking and resumes after Mycroft is done.
Saves last played position so you can resume without having to remember where you last stopped!
This is especially useful if you are playing an audiobook.
