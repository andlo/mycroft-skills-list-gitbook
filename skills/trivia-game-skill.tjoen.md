### _trivia-game-skill.tjoen_  
## Description:  
This skill uses mycrofts pocketsphinx STT with a small dict.

It uses a localstt.dic (dictionary) and localstt.lm (language model) in the res folder.

At the moment, the skill will ask you 3 "general knowledge" questions.
You can answer by choosing 1,2,3 or 4.

Yes, No, Stop, Repeat and Start should also work.

This started out as an experiment, checking if a faster method could make the  game more playable.
And it actually does seem to work pretty good.

Translations might be a problem with this method, but this skill uses questions in english.
