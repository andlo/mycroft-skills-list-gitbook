The skill provides the functionality to playback the video of any music band/album/playlist
or specific song requested by the user. No need to specify the location of the files or register any accounts.
Just say what you would like to listen to and enjoy.

Make sure to follow the pattern of "AV play *artist or song name*" or "play some *artist or song name*" and
add "music" or "playlist" at the end of your request.

For example:
Sample skill flow:

- Hey Mycroft, play some skillet album
- Would you like me to play it now?
- yes/ go ahead/ proceed
- Say stop when you are done

or -

- Hey Mycroft, play some classic music playlist
- Would you like me to play it now?
- No
- Let me know if you change your mind.
- Actually, go ahead
- Say stop when you are done.
