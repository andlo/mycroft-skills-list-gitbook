The skill can be configured to run scripts from easily pronouncable human utterances, such as "generate report" in the example.

```json
"CmdSkill": {
"alias": {
"generate report": "/home/forslund/scripts/generate_report.sh"
}
}
```

The configuration above will launch `/home/forslund/scripts/generate_report.sh` when the second utterance under usage is invoked.
