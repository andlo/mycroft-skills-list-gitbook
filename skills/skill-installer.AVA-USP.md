### _skill-installer.AVA-USP_  
## Description:  
Add and remove Skills using your voice or from the [Marketplace](https://market.mycroft.ai).
You can also assist skill authors in testing new versions of their skills by
using "install prevew version" to gain access to skills still under development
and testing.  If you do this, please be consicious the skill may be in an
unstable development state and report issues to the author appropriately.

You can also install Skills that are not officially released by entering the
Skill's GitHub repository URL in the [Installer's web user interface](https://home.mycroft.ai/#/skill).

Skills are ultimately installed using the [Mycroft Skill Manager (msm)](https://mycroft.ai/documentation/msm).  If verbally installing, Mycroft will speak a list of possible matches for
ambiguous names -- just pick the skill you want from the list read to you.
