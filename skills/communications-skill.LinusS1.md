### _communications-skill.LinusS1_  
## Description:  
Use this skill to broadcast messages across your home.
When this skill is installed on two or more of your devices, the devices will automatically find and connect to each other.

After they connect, you can say something like "Announce dinner's ready" and all your devices will say that message.
If you want to send a message to a specific device, all you need to say is "Ask the kitchen when dinner is ready."

If you want to reply to an announcement all you need to say is "Reply to the message"

The names of the devices, along with the placements, (the kitchen, Chris' room, etc...) can be named on [Mycroft Home](home.mycroft.ai). The names and placements are used to identify the device to send the message when you send a message.

**Setup**
On certain devices (most likely the Mark I), you will have to allow incoming connections through the firewall. Run the following commands on your device:

`sudo ufw allow from any to any port 4445 proto tcp`

`sudo ufw allow from any to any port 4446 proto tcp`

**If the skill does not work, make sure you've entered those commands, and restarted your device**

**Security**
The skill does try to do some basic security implementations, however you **MUST** run this on a WPA2 secured wifi network, if you use wifi.

**Roadmap**
This is only the beginning of this skill!
The future includes:
- Not having to allow ports in (this will be done automatically)
- Calling and video calling!
