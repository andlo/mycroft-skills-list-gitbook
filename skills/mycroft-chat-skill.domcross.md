## Description:  
In your skill settings you must enter your username (as given in your Mycroft Chat account settings) and your personal access token.
In case you do not have a token you can specify your login-id (usually that is your email) and your password.
NOTE: your password will be stored in clear text in your settings.json!)
There is also the option to set the time interval between refresh/check for updates.
When monitoring is active the skill will use that time period for automated checking.
The option "notify on updates" is only applicable when monitoring is active -
when the option is activated Mycroft willl speak out loud the number of unread messages and mentions.
