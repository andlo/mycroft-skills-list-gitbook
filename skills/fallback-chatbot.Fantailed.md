### _fallback-chatbot.Fantailed_  
## Description:  
WARNING Do NOT install this skill if you aren't at least somewhat familiar with linux as it WILL break your Picroft installation!!!
Because of the mere size of Program-Y, there are a few incompatibilities and installation difficulties that have to be manually resolved.
Please read the whole description before proceeding.
This skill makes use of the offline Python AIML2.0 interpreter Program-Y.
At the moment, it only supports my own stupid bot called BakaBot, but adding your own bots will be supported very soon.
Some dependencies of Program-Y have to be installed with a pip version prior to 10. If the automatic installation of dependencies doesn't work, try downgrading to pip 9.0.3 first
pip install pip==9.0.3.
Then, install Program-Y manually using pip install programy.
This will break Mycroft in its current state as one of the dependencies requires websocket-client>=0.35.0 to work. As a result, pip will update websocket-client to a version that Mycroft in turn does not support anymore. Downgrade to 0.35.0 and you should be fine
pip install websocket-client==0.35.0
If the lxml install fails, do the following
sudo apt install -y libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev python3-pip
sudo pip3 install lxml
Note that the installation of lxml can be very slow on low RAM devices like the Raspberry Pi I am talking in the order of 10min+!. If you
ever doubt that it's even doing anything, open another terminal and run htop on it.
