I've written a couple of scripts to get you started.  Keep in mind these might not work if the screen saver is on.

- [`samples/fmp`](https://github.com/the7erm/mycroft-skill-simple-media-controls/tree/master/samples/fmp) - [fmp](https://github.com/the7erm/fmp-pg)
- [`samples/xdotool`](https://github.com/the7erm/mycroft-skill-simple-media-controls/tree/master/samples/xdotool) - [xdotool](https://www.semicomplete.com/projects/xdotool/xdotool.xhtml) - emulates `XF86AudioPlay`, `XF86AudioPrev`, and `XF86AudioNext` being pressed.

If you write your owns scripts, please feel free to fork the project, add them to the `samples/` and create a pull request.
