## Description:  
### "read all utterances"
Enter a list of phrases in Skill settings to verify which Skill and intent handler is triggered. Phrase list should be in format:
> phrase one, phrase two, phrase three

Alternatively provide a csv of phrases at: `~/.mycroft/skills/SkillTesting/utterances.csv`

If a phrase contains a comma it must be surrounded with quotation marks:
> phrase one, "phrase, two", phrase three

Additional options include:
- test_identifier - title of the test for your benefit eg 'weather phrases' - default timestamp of test comppletion time.
- delay - the period in seconds between each phrase - default 30

Results will be uploaded to termbin.com in csv format and the link will be emailed to you. A csv file of the results will also be saved on the device at: `~/.mycroft/skills/SkillTesting/reading-output/{test_identifier}.csv`. Note that when creating the filename, characters not in [a-z, A-Z, 0-9, [.\_-]] will be removed eg "weather phrases" will become "weatherphrases.csv". This file can be used to generate integration tests for all phrases.
