description: Skill for Adventure game by Crowther and Woods

This is a faithful port of the “Adventure” game to a Mycroft Skill from the original 1977 FORTRAN code by Crowther and Woods.

Adapted from [python-adventure](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/python-adventure), the python port of the game.
