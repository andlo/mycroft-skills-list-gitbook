rasa-chat

The package Rasa is a nice fit for Mycroft, as it allows you to build conversational agents without handing over your data to a third-party service. This package is designed to hit the Rasa REST endpoints and speak the resultant messages.

To start a chat, say "chat with bot" and to end it, say "stop"

Once you're chatting, this skill will override most Mycroft functionality, and you will be in a conversation with the Rasa bot until you end the chat or are silent too long.
