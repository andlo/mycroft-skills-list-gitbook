JIRA Agent

Once configured to connect to your on-premises Atlassian JIRA server with Service Desk installed and with a dedicated service agent account (i.e., an ordinary JIRA user login with membership in the jira-servicedesk-users group, dedicated to the device), Mycroft will be able to answer some simple questions about open issues and allow you to raise a new issue through a dialogue. Your IT service desk will now be staffed even when you are at lunch. Or service desk technicians can send Mycroft to department status meetings on their behalf. Mycroft can be a part of your technical support team.
