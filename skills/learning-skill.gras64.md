### _learning-skill.gras64_  
## Description:  
This Skill helps to give Mycroft a personality by learning any new information that you provide.
if mycroft not understood mycroft you. you can immediately train the previous request by saying "I want to explain it" or "houmor is probably not your strength".
then you do not have to do everything from the beginning.
if you say "use the alarm skill" you have the possibility to extend existing intents and save them to /.mycroft/skills/learning/skills.
I would like to set up an integration of intents into existing skills. currently only intents are processed and no voc.
