Calendar

With this skill, you can access your iCal server, or just use a [local calendar on your device](https://bit.ly/mycroft-calendar-ics), that doesn't sync anywhere. This skill needs configuration if your use an iCal server. You can (if you're technical) use a local file and not store your server credentials with Mycroft Home, if you follow the instructions [here](https://bit.ly/mycroft-calendar-local).
