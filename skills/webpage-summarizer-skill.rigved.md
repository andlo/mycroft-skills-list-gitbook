## Description:  
This skill reads out summaries of all the provided web pages. The web pages and their accompanying summaries are managed by the [Webpage Summarizer Service](https://github.com/rigved/webpage-summarizer-service). This skill then reads out the summaries for all the web pages in the queue of the service.

This Mycroft AI Webpage Summarizer Skill and the accompanying [Webpage Summarizer Service](https://github.com/rigved/webpage-summarizer-service) helps to convert all this incoming information into something more manageable.
