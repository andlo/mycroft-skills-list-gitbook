The Mycroft Mark 1 has several unique capabilities which this Skill lets you control.

### Eye Color
The Mark 1 has beautiful eyes -- and you get to pick their color!  Set them to
a named color ("blue", "magenta", "teal", etc) or any color using RGB values.
Pleas see the [color](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-mark-1/blob/dev/dialog/en-us/colors.value)

###  Faceplate Brightness
Set the faceplate to a specific brightness, or allow it to automatically adjust
its brightness level to dim at night.
