description: who let the dog inside - Mycroft will fart when requested or at random intervals
---

### _farting-skill.andlo_  
## Description:  
This is just a fun skill that should generate a laugh or two and then never be used again.

When asked "who did that", Mycroft will answer with a statement such as "it wasn't me. it was the dog".

When told to "make a farting sound", Mycroft will play a randomly selected fart sound file, followed by
a statement such as "did someone sit on a whoopee cushion".

When told to "let one slip" or "fart randomly", Mycroft will play a fart sound file and make a comment
at a random interval between 1 minute and half an hour. This will continue until Mycroft is requested
to stop via "halt farting".

This is a rewrite of (@aussieW) skill-farting so it will work on Mycroft-core 19.8.
