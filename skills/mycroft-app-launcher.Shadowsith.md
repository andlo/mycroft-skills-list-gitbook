The App Launcher Skill allows to open and close linux desktop applications
with simple open/close commands. It is very similiar to [Desktop
Launcher](https://github.com/MycroftAI/skill-desktop-launcher) from Mycroft but
ony uses subprocesses to open/close programs. It also gives you a message if a
application is not found on the device.
