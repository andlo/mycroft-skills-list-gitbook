### _Pi_AI.eodas_  
## Description:  
This Skill demonstrates how to interact with the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins using a Mycroft Skill. This Skill shows both reading data from a GPIO port (detecting a button press) and writing data to the port (illuminating an LED).

### Preparation

[You will need to first install the GPIO libraries for Picroft, and add some additional permissions](https://mycroft.ai/documentation/picroft/#using-the-gpio-pins-on-the-raspberry-pi-3).

### Installing from the `makefile`

* Change the Makefile IP address for the RPi installation to the IP address of your RPi.

That is, edit the file `makefile` using your favorite editor like `nano` or `vi`.

The line you will need to change is `scp -r * pi@192.168.205.115:/opt/mycroft/skills/skill-gpio`.

Change this to have the IP address of your RPi.

* Create the folder ```/opt/mycroft/skills/skill-gpio``` on the RPi for the installer.

You can do this by using the command `mkdir /opt/mycroft/skills/skill-gpio`

* Build the code using the `makefile`.  ```make install.pi```

### Notes

If the LED blinking is too fast, it will be difficult to get a command to execute because there will be a voice response when the the LED turns off and on. Turn the blinking to a lower frequency to be able to execute commands.
