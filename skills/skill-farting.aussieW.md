description: Mycroft will play a farting sound when requested or at random intervals
---
This is just a fun skill that should generate a laugh or two and then never be used again.

When asked "did you fart", Mycroft will answer with a statement such as "it wasn't me. it was the dog".

When told to "make a farting sound", Mycroft will play a randomly selected fart sound file, followed by a statement such as "did someone sit on a whoopee cushion".

When told to "let one slip" or "fart randomly", Mycroft will play a fart sound file and make a comment at a random interval between 1 minute and half an hour. This will continue until Mycroft is requested to stop via "stop farting".

Has been tested on picroft and mark1.
