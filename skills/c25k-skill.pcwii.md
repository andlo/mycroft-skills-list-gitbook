description: Use mycroft.ai as a fitness coach and work your way through the 9 week Couch to 5km running program
---

### _c25k-skill.pcwii_  
## Description:  
Mycroft.ai becomes your motivational coach as you work your way through each of the intervals in the workout.
* Depending on the length of the current interval motivations will be provided at the 1/4, 1/2, 3/4
points of the interval.
This skill uses a schedule json (c25k.json) to track and support you as you work
through the couch to 5k running program.
The default c25k.json file is based on the Couch to 5 km running program.
Other workout json files could be created based on this and selected from the websettings.

The skill will keep track of the last week #, day # that you completed and proceed through each day
of the workout found in the json file.
* The skill will loose this information if the mycroft is rebooted or the skill is updated.
- Mycroft does not properly push websettings changes in skills to the web ui.
- I will work to address this in future updates (20200202).
