### _pvoutput-mycroft.wildmountainfarms_  
## Description:  
With this skill, you can ask Mycroft for the status of your solar panel system.
This retrieves data from https://pvoutput.org. You can ask it for today's
energy generation or last week's energy consumption.

Recommended to be used with [SolarThing](https://github.com/wildmountainfarms/solarthing), which can upload data to PVOutput.
There are also [numerous other programs](https://github.com/topics/pvoutput) that can upload data to PVOutput.

This requires you to set up an account on https://pvoutput.org to get an API key.

### Examples:  
> How much energy have the panels produced today?  
> How much energy have I used today?  
> How much energy was produced yesterday?  
> How much energy was generated last month?  
> How much energy have I used this year?  
> How much power am I using right now?  
> How much power are the solar panels generating?  
> What was my peak power?
