This skill is made to work with the full Habits Automation project https://github.com/PFE1718/mycroft-skills-automation.

Different cases :
- Skill trigger detected (calls the automation handler skill)
- Frequency habit detected (calls the automation handler skill)
- Habit completed for the first time (calls the automation handler skill)
- Inactivity for more than 5 minutes after last command (calls the data mining skill)
