## Description:  
Play this classic Infocom game from the [Interactive Fiction Archive](http://www.ifarchive.org/).  Peek into the history of gaming, experiencing some of the very earliest examples of interactive worlds using only text -- but this time using your voice!

### Original Infocom Description
![](http://infocom.elsewhere.org/gallery/hhgttg/front_th.jpg)

As the story begins, you are Arthur Dent, and a bulldozer is preparing to level your house even as an alien space fleet is preparing to level your planet. The incorrigible Mr. Adams has written new material and designed problems, especially for this interactive story. So grab a pint of bitter and a couple for the road and join Ford Prefect, Trillian, Zaphod Beeblebrox and Marvin on a cosmic jaunt into the outer reaches where anything can -- and does -- happen. And don't forget your towel!

Example Gameplay:

``play hitchiker guide``

> you wake up
> the room is spinning very gently round your head
> or at least it would be if you could see it which you can't
>
> it is pitch black
>
>

``turn on light``

> good start to the day
> pity it's going to be the worst one of your life
>
> the light is now on
> bedroom, in the bed the bedroom is a mess
> it is a small bedroom with a faded carpet and old wallpaper
> there is a washbasin, a chair with a tatty dressing gown slung over it, and a window with the curtains drawn
> near the exit leading south is a phone
> there is a flathead screwdriver here
> (outside the bed) there is a toothbrush here.
