Device Configuration

User and device settings from [home.mycroft.ai](https://home.mycroft.ai) are
synchronized with your Devices.  This Skill performs that synchronization and
allows you to check your settings.

You can also change the technology used to perform Wake Word spotting.  This is
the system that wakes the device up when you say "Hey Mycroft".
