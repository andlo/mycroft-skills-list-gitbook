# Timer  
### _mycroft-timer.MycroftAI_  
## About:  
Use Mycroft when your hands are messy or you need more that the one timer in your kitchen.  Multiple timers are easy to set and track with conversational interactions.
On a Mark 1 you'll see visual feedback as the timer runs, and you can use
the top button to stop the beeping once a timer expires.
