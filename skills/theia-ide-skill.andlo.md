packages for other platforms. Installer wil always install latest Theia-for-Mycroft from
https://github.com/andlo/theia-for-mycroft/
* Installer Builds and compile on systems where there isnt precompiled package for if system has more
than 4 Gb memmory.
* No more support for Mark_1 as debian jessie isnt supported and theia cant build properly.
* Added workspace setting on home.mycroft.at. Default to skills directory.
* Debug is working by using PTVSD, but requere remote-debug skill to activate and inject
debug adaptor https://github.com/andlo/remote-debug-skill and change settings for padatious
