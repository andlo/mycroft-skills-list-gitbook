## Description:  
This is a demo script to activate GPIO pins in a Raspberry Pi using a verbal command in Picroft installations. It activates pin 11 in (BOARD) configuration twice. You should see 2 pulsations of an LED, small motor, or speaker depending on what you want to attach to the pins. A breadboard with female-to-male jumpers and a resistor is recommended for ease of use with the Pi's pins.
