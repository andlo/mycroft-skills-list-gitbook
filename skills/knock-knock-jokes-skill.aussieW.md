A skill for telling Knock Knock jokes.

The user requests Mycroft to tell a knock knock joke and then interacts with Mycroft in the delivery of the joke. Mycroft expects the user to reply with certain keywords to allow the interaction to progress smoothly.

Here is a sample interaction

User: "Hey Mycroft, tell me a knock knock"

Mycroft: "knock knock"

User: "who's there" <<< must be this response

Mycroft: "says"

User: "says who" <<< must have the word 'who' somewhere in the response

Mycroft: "says me, that's who"

User: rotfl.
