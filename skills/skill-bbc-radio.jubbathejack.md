## Description:  
A Mycroft skill to play BBC radio stations. I intend to implement a feature to allow for dynamic
selection of any of the radio stations that the BBC operates. It currently is only configured
to play BBC radio 1 just to get the skill up and running. I then intend to implement the
feature for multiple stations.
