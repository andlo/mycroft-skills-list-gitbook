### _wake-word-skill.gras64_  
## Description:  
Wakeword is only a few times spoken and bad detection sorted out. you could not do that through speech. i have thought about it and make a skill.
This skill should make it easier for everyone to use their own precise wake words and make it possible for everyone. you can also turn on a small webserver to check your audiofiles at http://mycroft_ip:8082.
