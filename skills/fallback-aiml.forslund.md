description: Give Mycroft some sass with AIML!
---

### _fallback-aiml.forslund_  
## Description:  
The fallback leverages the [Alice chatbot](https://www.chatbots.org/chatbot/a.l.i.c.e/) to create some fun interactions.  Phrases not explicitly handled by other skills will be run by the chatbot, so nearly every interaction will have _some_ response.  But be warned, Mycroft might become a bit obnoxious...

The AIML takes up a considerable amount of memory so the skill is disabled by default. To enable go to Skillsettings under home.mycroft.ai

This is based on the original work of [JarbasAI](https://github.com/JarbasAI) with updates from all over the Mycroft community.
