description: Play downloaded mp3 files on your Music path with MycroftAI on Linux
---

### _local-music-skill.thevirtuoso1973_  
## Description:  
This is a 'skill'/add-on for the MycroftAI assistant that lets you play mp3 files on your computer.

Mycroft currently looks through the files in `~/Music` (`/home/Music`) path to see if the song mentioned is present.
You can edit the code in `__init__.py` if you want it to look through another directory.

It compares the filenames to the user's request and plays the matching song, if a match is confident enough.

N.B. you can put a bunch of mp3 files in a folder and ask it to play _folder name_ and it'll play all the songs in that folder. Great for albums!
