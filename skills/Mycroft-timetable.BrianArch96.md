### _Mycroft-timetable.BrianArch96_  
## Description:  
This skill allows a student, using their personal University of Limerick student ID, to request details about their timetable. Via this skill, a user can request details for a given day or period of a day.
The skill also allows student to request details about modules such as the full name of the module and it's primary lecturer.

Current timetable and module information comes from the official [University of Limerick Timetable Site](https://www.timetable.ul.ie/) which is available to the public.

Once pulled, the Skill starts with my own Student ID. This can be changed with the following command:

``` Student 1234567```

Once it's been successfully changed, you can then use the **Timetable Skill** with your own Student ID.
