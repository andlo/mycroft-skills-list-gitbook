A skill to get simple directions (time and distance) via MyCroft.

You need to create an account at https://openrouteservice.org/ and create an API-KEY/API-TOKEN put this on home.mycroft.ai under skill settings.
After this restart your MyCroft Unit or give mycroft some time to sync the settings.

Settings:
- OPENROUTESERVICE-APIKEY: API-Key from OpenRouteService
- DISTANCE-UNIT: this may be KM (for kilometers) or MI (for miles)

HowToUse:

"Hey mycroft, give me directions from Richmond Hill Road New York to 39th street kansas city"
