### _mycroft-confluence-search-skill.stratus-ss_  
## Description:  
This skill is hosted on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/stratus-ss/mycroft-confluence-search-skill)and mirrored to GitHub
.The main purpose of this skill is to be able to search an Atlassian Confluence Wiki and return the results to a Telegram group of channel. It will
send results in groups of two and after the first 2 are displayed ask the user if more results should be returne.

You can as for a general title search, or if you know the page you want is nested, ask Mycroft to narrow the results based on a parent page.
This skill uses fuzzy searching so it is unlikely that only 1 match will be returned.
