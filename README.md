For the time beeing it is only manual updated. In time it will be updatet at least once every 24 hour

#### How does a skill get to this list?
This list is made from searching Github for skills repositories. It is done by searching every repo that mention
Mycroft somewhere in tittle, reponame, or in README.md.
<p>Then each repo is analyzed to see if it is a skill. That is done by looking into __init__.py. If it is a skills
the README.md file is parsed and used combined with Github info and Mycroft market info to make the json data that
is used to make the list.</p>

The json data file can be found <a href='https://github.com/andlo/mycroft-skills-list/raw/master/_data/skills.json'>here</a>


#### How do I install the skills onto my device?
You dont - this isnt a amrketplace, appstore or anything like that.

#### Can the skills listed be installed onto a device?
Yes - if the skill isnt in the Mycroft market, you can install the skill using mycroft-msm or git clone.
But do read on each skills own github page for how to install, use and what does work etc.
If a skill isnt working for you, open a issue on the github page or even better fork the skill, make It
work and make a pull request

#### Why does the list containing skills that arent working or outdated?
The list is made to get overview over what exists and make a way to search for skills.

The list does not include forks. If you did fork a skill, and did make it better, please make a pull request to the
original github repo.
If you made a fork, and changed it into a new skill, do use github copy to make a new reposotry that arent a fork.
