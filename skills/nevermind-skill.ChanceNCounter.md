description: Dismisses Mycroft  **DON'T INSTALL THIS!** The name doesn't play nice with STT right now, so you're going to have a hard time installing or removing it verbally. The skill has been renamed, and this repo will likely be deleted once the new repo is committed to the Marketplace.  If you're trying to fuss with the code, or to install the skill manually, use this repo instead:  https://github.com/ChanceNCounter/dismissal-skill

~~Nevermind~~

Allows you to dismiss Mycroft verbally, in case of accidental activation, or if you change your mind. By default, Mycroft will confirm this action, but there is a setting to disable verbal feedback, accessible over the web interface.
