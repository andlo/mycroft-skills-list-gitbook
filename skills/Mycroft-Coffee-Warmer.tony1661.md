# Coffee Warmer Mycroft Skill  
### _Mycroft-Coffee-Warmer.tony1661_  
## About:  
A custom Mycroft skill I created to turn my sonoff on and off for my coffee mug warmer. Included is the custom sonoff firmware I got from another website which I slightly modified for my needs. You can find that firmware in the sonoff.cfg file. I am using a Sonoff Basic.
