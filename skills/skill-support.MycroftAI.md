### _skill-support.MycroftAI_  
This Skill generates a package with debugging information and emails it to the email address registered in your home.mycroft.ai account. This package can be used for debugging issues yourself, or alternatively it can be emailed to Mycroft to create a support request.
The package contains all of your mycroft-core logs on the Device, and information about active Skills and Intents at the time the support request was generated.
This uses the 0x0.st service for storing the debugging information.
