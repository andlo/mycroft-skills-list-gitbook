Number Guess

In Number Guess, you provide a lower and upper bound, then try to guess the randomly generated number between those bounds. With this skill, Mycroft can play with you! Ask Mycroft to generate a random number, try to guess, and Mycroft will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or spot on.
