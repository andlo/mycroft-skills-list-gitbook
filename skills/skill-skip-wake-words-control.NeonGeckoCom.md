### _skill-skip-wake-words-control.NeonGeckoCom_  
## Description:  
Skill, which works using Mycroft-core with NeonGeckoCom modifications, provides the user with the functionality to choose between continuous audio recording, which would not require wake words for Mycroft to work, and the "standard" mode, where the wake word "Hey Mycroft" is required.
Note: This skill would not proceed without the clear confirmation of the command from the user by asking "Should I stop skipping wake words?" and expecting a positive answer.
