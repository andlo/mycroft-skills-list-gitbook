Pandora provides dynamically generated internet radio streams.  Streams are
influenced by the the traits of the music played and the songs you like
or skip.

Using this skill does require a [Pandora.com](https://pandora.com) account.
Sign-up is free with ad-supported streams.

This skill should work with Mycroft version 0.9.1 +
