this service requires a server to treat the results and manage the sources. The code for this server is an XWiki Application provided here: https://github.com/ldubost/xwiki-sports-skill/ which currently supports only the Tennis French Open 2019.

A server is running at http://wiki-scores.org/ where you can test the capabilities of that skill.
