The Kodi Controller Skill allows Mycroft to control Kodi, whether locally installed
or on another device on the local network.  It will allow a high degree of control
over Kodi, including the ability for the user to specify a device IP for the Kodi
player (allowing the skill to control Kodi on multiple different devices without
requiring the user to manually edit the skill's settings), to search for videos and
music, and to control playback.
