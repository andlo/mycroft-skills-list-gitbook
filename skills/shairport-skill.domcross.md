# Shairport  
### _shairport-skill.domcross_  
## About:  
This skill will install shairport-sync package that turns your Picroft (or Mycroft on a Debian-style Linux) into an airplay audio player. Nothing fancy here like ducking or volume control, just turning Shairport-sync on and off.

This is just a quick hack I made on a rainy day that "works for me" and comes without any warranty or support.
