Apprise

With this skill you can send push notifications to a large number of notifications services including pushbullet, pushover, twitter, email and many many more - using the fantastic apprise lib...

Configure up to three services and/or use a configuration file (e.g. when you do not want to upload your username and password to home.mycroft.ai)
Please refer to the [apprise lib wiki](https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki) for detailed information on service url configuration.
For config file usage instructions please see the [apprise config file manual](https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki/config).
