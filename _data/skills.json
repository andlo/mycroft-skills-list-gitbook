            "description": "This skill adds [Remember The Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/) support to [Mycroft](https://mycroft.ai/).\nThe skill use Remember The Milk's [rest interface](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/api/).\nThe purpose if the skill is to allow operations suited for a voice interface. It is not an attempt to cover all functionality of remember the milk.\n\nAn authentication flow must be executed before other operations can be\ndone, see section [Configuration](##Configuration)\nSome advice on installation can be found in section [Installation](##Installation)\n\n### The dialog\nThe cows lists work with lists and tasks. When you mention a list or a task in a command to the cows lists,\nit will be remenbered for a short time (2 minutes). The task or list is said to be in context. Whthin this time, further commands to the cows list will refer to the list and/or task in context.\nFor instance:\n\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, find bananas on the grocery list\"\n* Mycroft: \"I found bananas on list grocery\"\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, complete it\"\n* Mycroft: \"bananas on list grocery was marked complete\"\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, read the list\"\n* Mycroft: \"List grocery has 3 tasks on it, potatos, apples, oranges\"\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, complete oranges\"\n* Mycroft: \"oranges on list grocery was marked complete\"\n\nSome commands support special dialogs. For instance\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, add bananas to the grocery list\"\n* Mycroft: \"bananas was added to list grocery\"\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, add oranges\"\n* Mycroft: \"oranges, anything else?\"\n* You: \"appels\"\n* Mycroft: \"apples, anything else?\"\n* You: \"potatos\"\n* Mycroft: \"potatos, anything else?\"\n* You: \"no\"\n* Mycroft: \"okay, the tasks are added to list grocery\"\n\nThe skill will try to recognize mispronounced list or task names, for example:\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, find call back on my bin box list\"\n* Mycroft: \"I can't find a list called bin box, do you want to use the list inbox instead?\"\n* You: \"yes\"\n* Mycroft: \"I did not find call back, but i did find call home on list inbox\"\n\n\n#### Commands\nThis section lists all available commands.\n\nIn general, for all operations below, you can substitute \"my\" list with \"the\" list, i.e. \"add milk to the grocery list\" and \"add milk to my grocery list\" are both valid.\n\nBe careful about using the word 'list' when you name the lists in Remember The Milk. For instance, the skill can handle a list called 'grocery' OR a list called 'grocery list', but if you have BOTH, the skill will only find the 'grocery list'.\n\n#### Add a task\nFor example:\n* \"Hey Mycroft, add milk to my grocery list\"\n* \"Hey Mycroft, add remember to call home to list Inbox\"\n\nThe skill is using Remember The Milk [\"smart add\"](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/help/?ctx=basics.smartadd.whatis.) For example:\n\n* \"Hey Mycroft, add remember to call home tomorrow at 9 to list Inbox\"\n\nwill add a task called \"remember to call home\" to the Remember The Milk's Inbox, and set the due date to tomorrow at 9. See also the due command later in this section.\n\n#### Complete task\nComplete a task on a list, the operation can be undone within 2 minutes:\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, complete call home on my personal list\"\n* Mycroft: \"Call home on list personal was marked complete\"\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, restore\"\n* Mycroft: \"I have restored call home on list personal again\"\n\n#### Complete all tasks on a list\nComplete all tasks on a list, this operation may take a while if there are many tasks. The operation can be undone within 2 minutes:\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, complete all tasks on my grocery list\"\n* Mycroft: \"3 tasks on list grocery was marked complete\"\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, restore\"\n* Mycroft: \"I have restored 3 tasks on list grocery again\"\n\nTo keep processing time down, a maximum of 40 tasks can be deleted for each complete list command. The\nRTM api has a rate limit of 1 call per second, 40 tasks will take approximately 40 seconds to complete.\nIf you use the Mycroft \"stop\" command during processing, it may not be possible to undo the operation.\n\n#### Due tasks\nFind out what tasks are due. Due date can be one of: \"now, yesterday, today, tomorrow, monday, tuesday, wedensday, thursday, friday, saturday, sunday\"\n\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, what is on my inbox list today\"\n* Mycroft: \"List inbox has 2 tasks on it, call home, go fishing\"\n\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, add go fishing today to the inbox list\"\n* Mycroft: \"go fishing today was added to list inbox\"\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, what is due today\"\n* Mycroft: \"List inbox has 1 task on it, that are due today, go fishing\"\n\n#### Find task on list\nFind a task on a list:\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, find milk on my grocery list\"\n* Mycroft: \"I found milk on list grocery\"\n\n#### Read list\nRead the tasks on a list:\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, read list inbox\"\n* Mycroft: \"List inbox has 2 tasks on it, call home, go fishing\"\n\n#### Undo\nIf an operation makes changes to your lists or tasks, it can be undone within 2 minutes, for example:\n\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, add call home to list inbox\"\n* Mycroft: \"call home was added to list inbox\"\n* You: \"Hey Mycroft, undo\"\n* Mycroft: \"I have removed call home from list inbox again\"\n\nThe words \"undo\", \"revert\", \"roll back\" and \"restore\" can be used\n\n#### Report an error\nIn case of a technical error, the cows lists will ask you if you want a mail with the details. Answer yes, and you will receive a mail from Mycroft with further details on how to report the issue, and all the details about the error.\nYou receive the mail, it is not sent the skill developer. The mail contains detalis about how to report the error to the skill developer,\nand you decide what information to put in the issue report.\n\nOther issues that are not caught as describe above, can be reported as well, on https://github.com/CarstenAgerskov/skill-the-cows-lists/issues.",

            "description": "This skill has two purposes:\n1) Instead of triggering a skill by asking Mycroft a question, this skill triggers when a text message is received on mqtt.\nIt can be used for notifications. For instance, a smart home server could publish the text \"Somebody is at the door\", if the doorbell is pressed.\nIt is possible to make Mycroft repeat the last text it received on mqtt.\n\n2) Send an utterance in text from mqtt, to activate other skills. For instance, if your\nhome automation detect that a window is opened, send the text \"_utterance remind me to close the window in 10 minutes\" on mqtt to\ntrigger the \"reminder\" skill.\n\n\n### Configuration\nThe skill is configured on your \"Mycroft Home\" page. Configure the mqtt server, port and topic that the skill will listen for text messages on.\nCurrently, password or certificates are not supported. (Maybe I will implement it if you promise to test it :)\n\nA restart of the skill is needed when changing the configuration.\n\nOptionally, it is possible to split the text, using a regular expression.\n\nExample CamelCase: If you send the string \"KitchenWindow is open\",\nyou want to split KitchenWindow. After the split Mycroft will say \"Kitchen Window is open\". To do that set the parameters on \"Mycroft Home\" like this:\n* Split text at pattern (optional): [a-z][A-Z]\n* Retain characters in matched string until index: 1\n* Retain characters in matched string from index: 1\n\nWhat happens: The regex match \"nK\" in \"KitchenWindow is open\". We retain the characters until index 1 of \"nK\", which is n.\nWe retain the characters after index 1 of \"nK\", which is K. And we put a space in the middle.\n\nExample hypen: Convert \"Outside-temperature is -5 degrees\" to \"Outside temperature is -5 degrees\"\n* Split text at pattern (optional): [a-z|A-Z]-[a-z|A-Z]\n* Retain characters in matched string until index: 1\n* Retain characters in matched string from index: 2\n\nWhat happens: The regex match \"e-t\" in \"Outside-temperature is -5 degrees\".  We retain the characters until index 1 of \"e-t\", which is e.\nWe retain the characters after index 2 of \"e-t\", which is t. And we put a space in the middle.\n\nExample underscore: Convert \"Kitchen_window is open\" to \"Kitchen Window is open\"\n* Split text at pattern (optional): _\n* Retain characters in matched string until index: 0\n* Retain characters in matched string from index: 1\n\nWhat happens: The regex match \"_\" in \"Kitchen_window is open\".  We retain the characters until index 0 of \"_\", which is no characters.\nWe retain the characters after index 1 of \"_\", which is no characters. And we put a space in the middle.",

This allows playback\nservices to negotiate which is best suited to play back a specific request.\nThis capability is used by the [Spotify](https://github.com/forslund/spotify-skill) and [Pandora](https://github.com/mycroftai/pianobar-skill) Skills, among others.",

Use Mycroft to easily interact with nearby lights and light groups you create within the Wink ecosystem.\n\nYour can easily find the right light or lights based on the names of lights and groups.  The Mycroft device's Name (set at [Home](https://home.mycroft.ai/ -- check by asking \"what is your name?\")\ncan be used to find lights and/or groups with begin with that same name. For example, if your Mycroft device's location is set to 'Kitchen' and you say \"Turn on the light\", lights with the following names would be turned on:\n\n* Kitchen\n* Kitchen sink\n* Kitchen fan (group consisting of 'Fan 1', 'Fan 2', 'Fan 3')\nIt will NOT turn on a light called \"Porch off the kitchen\".\n\nYou can also include the light/group name in your request, along with intensity words, such as: `bright`, `dim`, `full`, `half`, `completely`, `partially`",

In case you do not have a token you can specify your login-id (usually that is your email) and your password. NOTE: your password will be stored in clear text in your settings.json!)\n\nThere is also the option to set the time interval between refresh/check for updates. When monitoring is active the skill will use that time perioed for automated checking.\nThe option \"notify on updates\" is only applicable when monitoring is active - when option is activated Mycroft willl speak out loud the number of unread messages and mentions.\n\nYou can also specify the server configuration. Default settings are for chat.mycroft.ai so you should already be ready to go. NOTE: change anything here and you are on your own! ;-)",

You can find a detailed definition of a **habit** on the [project page](https://github.com/PFE1718/mycroft-habits-automation).\n\nThis skill allows you to automate some of the habits that Mycroft has detected and it handles their automation. When you first reproduce a detected habit, Mycroft will ask you if this habit should be automatized.\n\nThe habit detection is done by two other complementary skills:\n1.

            "description": "This skill has two purposes:\n1) Instead of triggering a skill by asking Mycroft a question, this skill triggers when a text message is received on mqtt.\nIt can be used for notifications. For instance, a smart home server could publish the text \"Somebody is at the door\", if the doorbell is pressed.\nIt is possible to make Mycroft repeat the last text it received on mqtt.\n\n2) Send an utterance in text from mqtt, to activate other skills. For instance, if your\nhome automation detect that a window is opened, send the text \"_utterance remind me to close the window in 10 minutes\" on mqtt to\ntrigger the \"reminder\" skill.\n\n\n### Configuration\nThe skill is configured on your \"Mycroft Home\" page. Configure the mqtt server, port and topic that the skill will listen for text messages on.\nCurrently, password or certificates are not supported. (Maybe I will implement it if you promise to test it :)\n\nA restart of the skill is needed when changing the configuration.\n\nOptionally, it is possible to split the text, using a regular expression.\n\nExample CamelCase: If you send the string \"KitchenWindow is open\",\nyou want to split KitchenWindow. After the split Mycroft will say \"Kitchen Window is open\". To do that set the parameters on \"Mycroft Home\" like this:\n* Split text at pattern (optional): [a-z][A-Z]\n* Retain characters in matched string until index: 1\n* Retain characters in matched string from index: 1\n\nWhat happens: The regex match \"nK\" in \"KitchenWindow is open\". We retain the characters until index 1 of \"nK\", which is n.\nWe retain the characters after index 1 of \"nK\", which is K. And we put a space in the middle.\n\nExample hypen: Convert \"Outside-temperature is -5 degrees\" to \"Outside temperature is -5 degrees\"\n* Split text at pattern (optional): [a-z|A-Z]-[a-z|A-Z]\n* Retain characters in matched string until index: 1\n* Retain characters in matched string from index: 2\n\nWhat happens: The regex match \"e-t\" in \"Outside-temperature is -5 degrees\".  We retain the characters until index 1 of \"e-t\", which is e.\nWe retain the characters after index 2 of \"e-t\", which is t. And we put a space in the middle.\n\nExample underscore: Convert \"Kitchen_window is open\" to \"Kitchen Window is open\"\n* Split text at pattern (optional): _\n* Retain characters in matched string until index: 0\n* Retain characters in matched string from index: 1\n\nWhat happens: The regex match \"_\" in \"Kitchen_window is open\".  We retain the characters until index 0 of \"_\", which is no characters.\nWe retain the characters after index 1 of \"_\", which is no characters. And we put a space in the middle.",

The default work time is 25 minutes, the default break time is 5 minutes and the default long break time is 15 minutes.\n2. If you want to change the work time or the break time in speech, say the work time first.\n3. Not recommended to put the break time longer than the work time.\n4. Not recommended to put the work and break time too short (below 10 seconds).\n\n### Terminology:\n1. A cycle is one finished work and one finished break.\n2. A run is four finished cycles.\n3. A long break is a duration taken each run.\n4. A session is all works and breaks taken after stopping pomodoro.\n\n### TODO:\n1. Make a record to store the sessions.\n2. Ask to save the session each time finishes.\n3. Keep record of distractions during the session.\n4. Integrate with the enclosure.\n5. Switchable fun mode!",

            "description": "This mycroft skill passes commands to a MagicMirror installed on a Raspberry Pi. It requires a working install of [MagicMirror](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror) and the [MMM-Remote-Control module](https://github.com/Jopyth/MMM-Remote-Control) must be installed AND ACCESSIBLE ON YOUR LOCAL NETWORK.\n\nThis skill requires MMM-Remote-Control be installed and working properly.\n\nYou must configure the MagicMirror's config.js file to properly whitelist the ip address of your Mycroft.\n\nYou can use this skill to hide or show modules, update the mirror or individual modules,\nrefresh or restart the mirror, list installed modules, install modules by name (will still require you\nto configure the MagicMirror config.js by SSH or VNC), change pages of modules by either swipe commands\nor telling mycroft to \"go to page [number]\"(requires that [MMM-pages](https://github.com/edward-shen/MMM-pages)\nbe installed), restart or reboot the Raspberry Pi.\n\nMMM-Remote-Control requires the module identifier to know which module to\nperform ModuleActionKeywords on (HIDE|SHOW) for example. This skill parses the MODULE_DATA returned from\nthe MMM-Remote-Control and compares it to the file \"AvailableModules.json\"\nIt then creates another file called file \"AvailableModulesWithIdentifier.json\"\nto store the module identifier that matches the ModuleKeywords. Modules identifiers may change\ndepending on their order in the MagicMirror config.js file. Everytime you install a new module\nthe module identifiers may change. If you run into issues, restart MagicMirror and Mycroft,\nand this skill should update the changed module identifiers. Just be aware after installing new modules\nand updating the config.js file that voice commands may not work properly until you restart both\nMagicMirror and Mycroft.\n\nTo match what Mycroft hears to a module, for instance a user would say\n'weather' but if MMM-WunderGround is installed and displayed, it would be considered the \"weather\" module.\nThese adjustments are made by changing the \"mycroftname\" in the file \"AvailableModules.json\"\nFor example: search for \"weather\" in the file \"AvailableModules.json\" and change it's\nmycroftname to something other than weather like 'weather old' or 'current weather'.\nThen search for MMM-Wunderground and change it's mycroftname to 'weather'. The change must be\nto a module name that is also reflected in the ModuleKeywords.voc otherwise mycroft will not recognize the name.\nFor your changes to persist all modifications should be made to the file \"AvailableModules.json\"\n\nThe way this skill works is by requests.get(url,params) sending a get request to the MMM-Remote-Control module via\nurl for example 'http://localhost:8080/remote?action=someaction&param=someparameter'\n\nThis skill includes intents for 90% of what the MMM-Remote-Control module is capable of doing. The other 10% is a work in progress.",

A workaround is restarting the skill (or restarting Mycroft).\nThe problem only affects this skill. I am still looking for a solution to this.\n\n\n### Configuration\nThe skill is configured on your \"Mycroft Home\" page. Configure the mqtt server, port and topic that the skill will listen for text messages on.\nCurrently, password or certificates are not supported. (Maybe I will implement it if you promise to test it :)\n\nA restart of the skill is needed when changing the configuration.\n\nOptionally, it is possible to split the text, using a regular expression.\n\nExample CamelCase: If you send the string \"KitchenWindow is open\",\nyou want to split KitchenWindow. After the split Mycroft will say \"Kitchen Window is open\". To do that set the parameters on \"Mycroft Home\" like this:\n* Split text at pattern (optional): [a-z][A-Z]\n* Retain characters in matched string until index: 1\n* Retain characters in matched string from index: 1\n\nWhat happens: The regex match \"nK\" in \"KitchenWindow is open\". We retain the characters until index 1 of \"nK\", which is n.\nWe retain the characters after index 1 of \"nK\", which is K. And we put a space in the middle.\n\nExample hypen: Convert \"Outside-temperature is -5 degrees\" to \"Outside temperature is -5 degrees\"\n* Split text at pattern (optional): [a-z|A-Z]-[a-z|A-Z]\n* Retain characters in matched string until index: 1\n* Retain characters in matched string from index: 2\n\nWhat happens: The regex match \"e-t\" in \"Outside-temperature is -5 degrees\".  We retain the characters until index 1 of \"e-t\", which is e.\nWe retain the characters after index 2 of \"e-t\", which is t. And we put a space in the middle.\n\nExample underscore: Convert \"Kitchen_window is open\" to \"Kitchen Window is open\"\n* Split text at pattern (optional): _\n* Retain characters in matched string until index: 0\n* Retain characters in matched string from index: 1\n\nWhat happens: The regex match \"_\" in \"Kitchen_window is open\".  We retain the characters until index 0 of \"_\", which is no characters.\nWe retain the characters after index 1 of \"_\", which is no characters. And we put a space in the middle.",

Zap2iT is optional but will allow mycroft to tell you what is playing on the current channel.  Without it, it will only tell you the channel.\n\nCurrently, the following functions are working:\n* \"Tivo status\"\n* \"Tivo channel up\"\n* \"Tivo channel down\"\n* \"Tivo channel set 2 3 1\"\n* \"Tivo pause\"\n* \"Tivo play\"\n* \"Tivo off\"\n* \"Tivo on\"\n\nThese functions should be working but require some additional testing.  These are specifically to initiate and stop a recording in progress:\n* \"Tivo record\"\n* \"Tivo stop\"\n\nMycroft will respond with, e.g.:\n* \"Bob's Tivo is currently watching channel 231\"\n* \"Bob's Tivo is currently watching channel 231 Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (with your zap2it account setup and with the correct lineup selected with their service)\n* \"Bob's Tivo is off\"\n* \"Bob's Tivo is playing\"",

In the real world however many different temperaments may be\nused - see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_temperament - and octaves too can vary in\nsize, see  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stretched_octave.\n\nAlso Mycroft call middle C for \"C4\" : this is the commonest octave numbering but some\npeople call middle C for \"C3\" or even for \"C5\".",

            "description": "Get listings of US National Parks by state, have Mycroft read descriptions of  national parks and even test your knowledge of where National Parks are located.\n\nTo use this skill  you will need to obtain an API key from the [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/get-started.htm).  Just follow the link and fill in the form, it's free and you will not be required to create an account.  When the skill is installed there will be a new settings entry in the Skills section of [Mycroft Home](https://home.mycroft.ai) under National Parks.  Paste in your API key and click the Save button.  As soon as the skill picks up the API key it will be able to connect to the NPS servers.\n\nFor the purpose of this skill the term \"National Park\" is used loosely to refer to almost any property managed by the US National Park Service.  Properties with a designation of  National Monument, National Historic Site or National Recreation Area will be included in park listings.   The only designation that is explicitly excluded from park listings is National Historic Trail.  All information is provided by the National Park Service.\n\nWhen asking for a park description the skill will do a search on the words given, so one does not need to say the complete park name.  For example, 'describe Edgar national park\", \"describe Edgar Allan national park\" and \"describe Edgar Allan Poe national park\" will all provide a description of Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site.\n\nSince definite articles are dropped from speech, searches for descriptions of some properties will fail if they are included.  For example, trying to hear a description of Rosie the Riveter WWII Home Front National Historical Park by saying \"describe Rosie the Riveter national park\" will fail but \"describe Rosie national park\" and \"describe Riveter national park\" will succeed.\n\nAfter asking to be quizzed Mycroft will ask what state a particular National Park Service property is in.  The answer may be spoken after the beep without using the wake word but there will only be a few seconds to answer.  If Mycroft does not respond to the answer use the wake word with \"Repeat national parks quiz\" and answer after the beep.",

Thinger.io server provides an interface to manage all the IoT resources\nand automatically creates REST APIs with secure authentication mechanism to control the resources.\nThis skill at present only providing voice control for turning Red/Green led ON of OFF.\nBut it could be extended or new skills can be created using same tools to give Mycroft more capabilities to\ncontrol IoT devices via voice. As an example, room temperature sensor could be added to the NodeMCU board ( L35 analog temperature sensor is used here, check this article for\ntutorial on how to connect it with NodeMCU : http://www.instructables.com/id/Interface-LM35-With-NodeMCU/ ) and with few code addition, this skill allows Mycroft to fetch room temperature reading using voice command.\nThis skill has not yet been submitted to Mycroft skill set, as some code modifications ( like reading the authentication headers from config files) need to be done.\nThe sketch is also provided with this code (NodeMCUThinger.ino) which can be flashed into a NodeMCU unit.\nAlso, this repository contains a PDF file with overview of components required for creating and using this skill.\nDemo videos on YouTube:\n1. https://youtu.be/2W1dCUOKwTw    Demo to turn LEDs ON/OFF\n2. https://youtu.be/Tw6L6K-t1TA    Demo to query room temperature\n3. https://youtu.be/Zdkx1vZKKfw    Screencast walkthrough under the hood.",

            "description": "**WARNING**: Do NOT install this skill if you aren't at least somewhat familiar with linux as it WILL break your Picroft installation!!!\nBecause of the mere size of Program-Y, there are a few incompatibilities and installation difficulties that have to be manually resolved.\nPlease read the whole description before proceeding.\n\n<br/>\nThis skill makes use of the offline Python AIML2.0 interpreter Program-Y.\n<br/><br/><br/>\n\nAt the moment, it only supports my own stupid bot called BakaBot, but adding your own bots will be supported very soon.\n\nSome dependencies of Program-Y have to be installed with a pip version prior to 10. If the automatic installation of dependencies doesn't work, try downgrading to pip 9.0.3 first:\n`pip install pip==9.0.3`.\n\nThen, install Program-Y manually using `pip install programy`.\n\nThis will break Mycroft in its current state as one of the dependencies requires `websocket-client>=0.35.0` to work. As a result, pip will update websocket-client to a version that Mycroft in turn does not support anymore. Downgrade to 0.35.0 and you should be fine:\n\n```pip install websocket-client==0.35.0```\n\nIf the lxml install fails, do the following:\n```\nsudo apt install -y libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev python3-pip\nsudo pip3 install lxml\n```\nNote that the installation of lxml can be _very_ slow on low RAM devices like the Raspberry Pi (I am talking in the order of 10min+!). If you\never doubt that it's even doing anything, open another terminal and run `htop` on it.",

This page, with a routeID and directionID, makes to POST calls to http://www.kc-metro.com/tmwebwatch/Arrivals.aspx/getStops to get a list of stops and http://www.kc-metro.com/tmwebwatch/Arrivals.aspx/getStopTimes to get the arrival times for a specific stop. Keep in mind some intersections have 2 stops, so direction matters.\n\nThis skill is still in it's early stages of development. With the planned expansions of the line, there will be tweaks needed. This is for the good of the KC and Mycroft communities, so please add/suggest new features.",
