description: Send network pings a.k.a. ICMP echo requests to internet nodes

### _ping-skill.nogre_  
## Description:  
This is a 3rd party skill that uses keywords to get either a server's ping time or status via ICMP echo requests. This can be used to check that a server is responding correctly. Alternatively, one can use this to send simple HTTP GET requests to a server to start or stop services. By using the Network Ping Skill, custom commands can be created for webhook-enabled online services.
For instance, saying, Mycroft Send a Ping to network node Google garners a reply of Pinged in 9.03 milliseconds.
If a keyword is set to get the server response, then Mycroft will reply, Server says OK 200, or Bad Gateway 502, et cetera.

Configuration of network node aliases is stored in a text file, hosts.txt, with one "keyword,setting,URL" per line
google,0,
This line will tell the Ping Skill that google is the keyword, 0 is for a Ping response and then the URL to ping. Alternatively, this
linux,1,
will respond to the linux keyword and return the server Status of linux.com, because of the 1 after the keyword.
If you are running server software that can respond to GET requests, such as Huginn, or there is a webservice without a prepackaged Mycroft skill that accepts webhooks, then a line like
hug, 1, 
and the corresponding settings on the remote end will make the Ping Skill into a basic remote control. Saying Mycroft Send a Ping Hug will load that URL, which will execute code on the server. Mycroft will reply, in the case of Huginn with a default Webhook Agent, with the custom server response, Event Created 201, to confirm the instruction was received and followed.
