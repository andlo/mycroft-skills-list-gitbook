The Mycroft Mark 1 menu which appears when you press and hold the top button
has a 'DEMO' option.  This Skill implements a simple mode which can be used
to draw attention at trade shows, stores, etc.

The demo starts with the unit's eyes dancing around.  Every 2 minutes it will
sing a song.  The singing is synched to the clock, so multiple units can form
a chorus.

You can stop the demo by pressing the top button or saying "Stop".
