Coffee Warmer Mycroft Skill

A custom Mycroft skill I created to turn my sonoff on and off for my coffee mug warmer. Included is the custom sonoff firmware I got from another website which I slightly modified for my needs. You can find that firmware in the sonoff.cfg file. I am using a Sonoff Basic.
