### _skill-joke.MycroftAI_  
## Description:  
Brighten your day with a little humor.  This draws on the jokes collected by the [PyJokes project](https://github.com/pyjokes/pyjokes) to give you a chuckle.

The joke categories are:
* Neutral -- jokes that are safe for work, kids or your grandmother
* Adult -- nothing horrible, but be ready to cover some ears
* Chuck Norris -- jokes only a geek can love

By default it will give you clean and/or geeky jokes, but you can ask a little adult humor if you feel that way.

_WARNING:  Laughter is not guaranteed, but eye rolls are likely._
