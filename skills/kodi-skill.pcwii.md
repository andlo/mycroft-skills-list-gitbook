Kodi Control

Utilize the kodi API and Python library for controlling the KODI open source media center with Mycroft.ai. The control is mostly geared towards videos/movies but is capable of handling cursor navigation as well.
The Kodi Skill uses conversational dialog to help you to control your KODI instance more naturally.
