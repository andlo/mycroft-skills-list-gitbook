### _password-creator-skill.LinusS1_  
## Description:  
This skill generates easy to remember passwords, using the XKCD method:
![xkcd style passwords](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png )

This skill randomly generates six words for you to use for your passwords. If you want, you can specify the number of words you want in your password. Also, you are able to ask to make a password acrostic, in other words give the skill a word, and the skill will give you a password where each word begins with a letter from the specified word.

For example, if I ask Mycroft to "Create a password that spells Linus," Mycroft would give me the password of "latch, immovable, numerate, underwire, and shifty"
