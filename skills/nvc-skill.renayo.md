## Description:  
This skill is based on the work of Marshall Rosenberg, PhD; particularly his book titled "Nonviolent Communication: a Language of Life" (third edition).

Nonviolent communication is a well-established body of social and communication strategies that "integrate consciousness, language, communication, and means of influence to increase our ability to live with choice, meaning, and connection; connect empathetically with self and others to have more satisfying relationships; and sharing of resources so everybody is able to benefit."
